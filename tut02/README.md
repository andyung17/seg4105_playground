## Chapter 2 - Principles of Shaping
- Not creating wireframes too early as creating prototypes are mean't to gather feedback and to iterate 
- Having features or descriptions descriptive to avoid ambuiguity
- <strong> It's Rough </strong>: Having work thats willing to be critiqued and improved will allow others to share insight on how to improve 
- <strong> It's Solved </strong>: The main solution is present without the specific intricatsies of tasks being present. Outlines the solution of product at hand 
- <strong> It's Bounded </strong>: Setting boundaries by leaving out specific details to ensure the details of the project gets covered 
- <strong> Who Shapes </strong>: Primary design work that requires being literate and understanding of the possibilties that can be done and not. Rough early work that anyone can do even non-programmers

## Chapter 3 - Set Boundaries
- Setting the boundaries by setting the <em> appetite </em> of finding features or tasks that pair well for the team based on time budget
- Differen't batches based on size of team but ultimately gets completed within a six week cycle
- "Fixed time, variable scope" represents having projects with set deadlines that ensure the scope is not infinite in size and trade-offs are made
- <em> Good </em> is relative as in setting the appetite, we can only create a good solution based on time constraints and judge based on that
- Narrowing down ideas should not always done early as shaping can yield with more important solutions not first sought out
- Having a raw idea, appetite, and narrowing a problem difinition work together to set the scope of a project based off time 

## Chapter 4 - Find the Elements
- Moving at the right speed is done by having the right people to bounce ideas off, while also having enough details (not too little or too much) to explore the solution
- <strong> Breadboarding </strong>is used to create a picture of the connections and sequence of actions without going over too much detail
- <strong> Fat marker sketches </strong> can be used to create low-cost UI sketches to describe how the systems work
- These methods help narrow down the elements needed for the solution which is involved in the shaping process
- On this stage, the solution may not be quite well understood by others outside of the team and can be ultimaetly closed
- This does add value to the <em> raw idea </em> by giving essential information in regards to it

## Chapter 5 - Risks and Rabbit Holes
- The solution now has to be inspected for any potential risks or holes that may need to be investigated into
- Looking for tricky problems or unknowns would help eliminate any potential <em> rabbit holes </em> that may postpone the launch or completion of it
- Now at this stage, instead we are now exploring the depth to critically identify if anything is missing or incorrect
- The team should know the <em> scope hammering </em> of the project to ensure what really fits within the context of the project (appetite)
- It is even possible for things to get cut out to make sure that it fits within the scope of the project and will not prolonge the cycle
- After, now the elements of the solutions have been made, with patches for any potential rabbit holes have be scoped to ensure its within bounds

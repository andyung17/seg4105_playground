## Chapter 2 - Principles of Shaping
- Not creating wireframes too early as creating prototypes are mean't to gather feedback and to iterate 
- Having features or descriptions descriptive to avoid ambuiguity
- <strong> It's Rough </strong>: Having work thats willing to be critiqued and improved will allow others to share insight on how to improve 
- <strong> It's Solved </strong>: The main solution is present without the specific intricatsies of tasks being present. Outlines the solution of product at hand 
- <strong> It's Bounded </strong>: Setting boundaries by leaving out specific details to ensure the details of the project gets covered 
- <strong> Who Shapes </strong>: Primary design work that requires being literate and understanding of the possibilties that can be done and not. Rough early work that anyone can do even non-programmers

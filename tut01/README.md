## Brainstorm

* Roles in Project Management is very confusing as the amount of variants differ only slightly in the aspects of managing a project 
    * Very much all similar 
* Specific “Roles” or “Variants” don’t always fit best in a workplace setting 
    * Often the mold of the variant doesn’t completely match the role
    * May contain combinations or omitting rules / principles altogether 
* No one specific construct fits any project management role in that aspect
    * Managers may be opposed to certain ways of approach from that variant
* Confusion in these roles creates a rippling effect even to other team members as the distinction between roles becomes vague / ambiguous 
* Meme: 
    * Take a meme that contains themes of confusion and show that each variant are not distinguishable 
* Variations in what the role PM means
    * Product manager 
    * Project manager 
    * Product owner
* Hard to distinguish between them all
* All seem to mean the exact same vs. function completely differently

"Variations can exist within the project in costs, activity durations, performance level and amount of resources available. Although different types of variations exist, the project plan still remains intact but the variation of the schedule or project can somehow affect the delivery of the project team". [Quote Found Here](https://project-management-knowledge.com/definitions/v/variation/)

* This quote illustrates the idea that variations exist in a project and trickles down to as low as the other members of the team 

* Product Managers: Gather requirements, designs, and other aspects of a project in regards of the product.
* Project Managers: Sets out a plan to complete and achieve completion of the project.

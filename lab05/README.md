## Questions
<strong> What will happen when users provide the same parameters or want more variation? If a user goes through routines or workouts and uses the same parameters will there be variation? (Luka)</strong>
- For more variations, there should be some sort of option to select certain workouts and ask/recieve similar workouts with some variations to it that follow similar criterion. If a user would to exactly answer the survery with the same parameter, it would indeed generate the same routine and workouts as it still is recieving the same criterion and does not generate based on randomness. Instead some sort of option should allow for filter or searching for similar workouts based on similar parameters.

<strong> How does this feature align with our overall value proposition for FitShare? (Khai)</strong>
- FitShare main goal is to allow kind of user to start working out and sharing their own workouts. This feature would simplify the process of creating a workout from a set of exercises by allowing any kind of individual to answer a few simple questions and get a workout tailored to their preferences immediately. This follows one of the main value propositions for FitShare of having a feature that supports another means of creating workouts for users using the application.

<strong> Adding Difficulty in the survey ex (beginner, experienced, pro)? (Avaneesh) </strong>
- The survey should have some questions relating to the level of experience questions reflected from the user. Once submitted, the survey should return a list and set of recommendation(s) that reflect the previous choices made with clear indications of the level of difficulty.   

<strong> Where do you think this feature or survey gets shown to the user? (Adhish) </strong>
- The workout generator should only be allowed for users after they have registed. This is to allow for workouts / routines to be saved, modified, and finding other options to accomdate users. Having this feature outside of the FitShare domain, this can lead to extra set of effort needed for public viewing rather simply viewing strictly within the application. This survey would be accessible through many methods, but one of the convient for the user should be somewhere on the homepage.

Workout Generation is broken down into 5-main components (scope) <br/>
1. Endpoints
2. Data Collection
3. Algorithm
4. UI
5. Survey

### <strong>Tasks</strong>
![Alt text](image-1.png)

The three main  features of the Algorithm Scope is 
- Generation of Workouts and Routines
    - Accepting input from survey
    - Formulating algorithm to handle inputs to generate workout based off preferences
    - Exporting to JSON
- Recommendation System
    - Receiving generated workout
    - Creating new recommended workouts
    - Recommending new workouts  
- Forming Metrics
    - Establishing forms of values (associations to input)
    - Creating choices of metrics

## What is a Pitch

- When deciding a new feature or product, it is essentially a direction statement or document
- Suggestion on how to solve the problem
- Leaving loose, enough detail but allow for flexibility for the team a final decision

## Formalized Pitch
- Anyone can write it, but one or two people are in charge of this work
- "Framing", defining the buisness problem before writing the pitch
    - Pitch defines the solution
    - Addressing problems from the customer
        - Identify many problems and finding common grounds that each relate too      

## Constraints
- Successful pitches work best from software developers / designers that are knowledgable on feasibility and limitations
- Deciding between tradeoffs, scope and more to define the solution space 

## Implemention
- The work itself and true implementation of the pitch is when it is being executed by the team
    - This is the stage when the pitch can get changed 
    - Allows for changes to be deferred until the implementation stage 

## 3-Pillars of a Pitch
- Autonomy
    - Having the affordance for change
    - Pitch having not enough detail and clarity such that developers and make final changes (if need be)
- Mastery
    - Understanding the context of scope and articulating into a solution keeping in mind constraints
- Purpose
    - Having a purpose of outlining problems that are relevant to the customer through the pitch
    - Solution should be clear about the impact and the implications to the customer

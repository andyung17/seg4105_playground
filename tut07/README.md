## Scrum Guide
- <strong> Daily Stand Up </strong>:
    - Short, daily meeting to discuss progress, help, and potential blockers that need resolving
        - Usually last 15-minutes as a time-boxed event
        - Held every day of a sprint 
        - Inspect progress towards sprint goals 
        - Inspect how progress is trending toward completion 
    - Called a stand up as participants should keep it short while "standing" 
    - In a virtual setting, talking is like standing as everyone else is remaining silent (sitting)
- Stand up keeps teams well informed, connected throughout a project
    - Optimizes team collaboration and performance
- To forecast upcoming sprint work
- Members:
    - Scrum Master
        - Ensuure the team has the meeting 
    - Development Team
        - Conducting daily scrum
    - Other members
        - Should not disrupt other members
- Benefit:
    - Communication
    - Eliminate other meetings
    - Identify impediments for development
    - Decision-making
    - Improve level of knowledge 

## Show Progress (Chapter 13)
- The tasks that aren't there
    - Needs a scope defined early without populating it with tasks
    - Think about some QA at the end of a scope
    - Needing more conext for the work inside of the scope 
        - Tasks may still upcoming / added and may not present the whole picture  
- Estimates don't show uncertainty
    - Estimates have different meanings depending on the nature of the work
        - Hard to distinguish numerical values 
    - To solve this issue, shifting the focus to what's done or not done 
        - Shifting the focus from left to right on the chart 
- Work is like a hill
    - Beginning: Planning
    - Uphill: What our approahc is and what we're going to do
    - Peak: Scoping for any important clues or to do's
    - Downhill: Getting the work done
    - End: Final remaining work left 
- Scopes on the hill
    - Snapshot of a project
    - Left side includes unknowns that need to be considered or worked out
    - On the right has known and no meaningful unknowns left 
- Status without asking
    - They can see which problems the team chose to solve 
    - Can view the progression of each tasks on the chart
    - Logs are  tracked 
- Nobody says "I don't know" 
    - Address the problem early or to rework / refactor
    - If it becomes unsolved, can linger in such a way to endanger a project
    - Hillcharts allow everybody to see progression and view stagnation 
- Prompts to refactor the scopes
    - Breaking down solutions into smaller scopes to move independently
    - Benefits come at the second order
    - Team can show more progress frequently than before
- Build your way uphill
    - When tasks go up and then down a hill is when they are using their head instead of their hands
    - think about the unknowns and whats uphill to avoid going back down 
- Solve in the right sequence
    - Scariest part is the uphill portion
    - Once at the top, scoping any critically important before finishing the downhill work
    - Better to get a few critical scopes over before finishing them
    - Called the "inverted pyramid" 
    - After finishing the important things, only the nice to haves and maybes should be left

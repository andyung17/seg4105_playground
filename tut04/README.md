## Chapter 7 - Bets, Not Backlogs
- Eliminating backlogs reduce the time wasters associated with a project
- Hold a `betting table`, only the pithces are potential options / bets
- Makes meetings infrqeuent (after 6 weeks)
- Decentralized list hold a list of bugs that are used in the `betting table`
    - Makes this more manageable, and ideas can be brought back with a purpose (reoccuring / pressing issue) 

## Chapter 8 - The Betting Table
- Defining a cycle the standardize the project scheduling
- Sprint planning does not allow for meaninful work to get done
    - The amount of planning overhead is not worth it compared to longer week cycles
- After the six-week cycle, there is a `cooldown period` for around two weeks that involves what is happening next
- They can work on whatever they want, and explore new ideas
- During the cooldown period, a betting table will be held to generate ideas for the next 6 weeks of activity
- Bets:
    - Have payouts
    - Commitment ot the team
    - Limit on the downsides
- Uninterrupted  time is essential to allow a team to capitalize on the six-weeks to get the bet done within the time frame
    - Any disturbances can throw members out of the flow and reduce productivity
- `Circuit breaker` are used to motivate teams to take ownership of the project to eliminate run-away projects of not getting shipped
- <strong> Bugs </strong> 
    - Using cool-down to generate a list that can be brought to the betting table
    - At the beting table, can breakdown and pitch bugs or ideas that need to be solved
    - Once a year, a cycle will be dedicated to solve / fix bugs 

## Chapter 9 - Place Your Bets
- At different stages of the process, betting can look different
- Exisiting projects will follow a shape up, bet and then give it to a team (not concerned with architectural changes)
- New products will need to consider the foundation in which it supports
    - `R&D mode`
        - Mainly bet the time on spiking some key pieces of a product
        - Judging the vision of the product for long-term effects and decision choices
        - Learning what works to know ahead of the structure 
    - `Production mode`
        - Work in formal cycles to shape, betting and building phases
        - Like working on an existing product
        - Flow of shaping, betting, and shipping (to main)
        - Always have the option to remove features before a launch
    - `Cleanup mode`
        - No shaping, and instead to bug smash
        - No team boundaries and anyone can jump in 
        - Work is shipped into small bites
        - Always considering if we are deliberatly working on a core must-have feature
        - Final decisions that dictate the rest of the project
            - After a feature is shipped, sometimes only then can we see what may require more attention
